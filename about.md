<span class = "initial">"W</span>elcome, foolish mortal. You have entered the territory of the about page. It is feared amongst the bravest of men, who, even with years of dedicated training, could never conquer the sheer boredom and lack of information this page has. The only way you shall be spared, is if you beg mercy of the lord and saviour, **Edgar Wex**. He is a student at DCGS, and can win almost any coding contest by demonstrating his lack of knowledge and frustrate coding wizards to death with it. `Nobody can defeat me`
